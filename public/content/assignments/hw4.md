# Homework 4: Modeling short sequences of words
-----

Language models provide the capability to predict the most likely set of texts to follow any preceding text, of which the simplest model is the *n*-gram model. We will be building our first language model in this homework trained on Twitter data. Review the homework in this [pdf file](pdfs/assignment-4.pdf). Remember that reading resources can be found in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus).

## data and starter kit
-----

You will need [the data](/cs6120f26/data/twitter/): the [`en_US.twitter.txt`](/cs6120s26/data/twitter/en_US.twitter.txt) file and [the code](/code/assignment4.py). You can read more about this data [here](https://github.com/bquast/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Online-Text-Exploration.md).

You will be filling out the portions in [the code](/cs6120f26/code/assignment4.py) that say `<YOUR-CODE-HERE>`. There is also helpful unit test code with the suffix `_test()`. For example, 

```python
def estimate_probabilities():
  """
  The graded function that you will need to fill out
  """
  # <YOUR-CODE-HERE>
  return None

def estimate_probabilities_test():
  """
  Ungraded: You can use this function to test out estimate_probabilities. 
  """
  # Run this function to test 
  return
```

You are free to *develop* in any environment (including [virtual machines](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) and [notebooks](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench)), but your submission must be a `*.py` file.
